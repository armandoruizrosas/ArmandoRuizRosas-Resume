        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public Policy, B.A.</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a first-generation American, I have come to understand the importance of playing an active role in my community. Motivated by this understanding, my professional experience is highly formed by my commitment to public service and addressing the needs of those around me. During high school, I was involved in various extracurricular activities that have sculpted my vocational and professional development to this day. At La Quinta High School (LQHS) I was responsible for leading various organizations such as Key Club and the Mock Trial Team as President. Additionally, as an International Baccalaureate Diploma recipient, I was on the Executive Board of the International Baccalaureate Club at LQHS. Lastly, I rose to the role of Cdt. 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) at LQHS. My leadership roles in Key Club, Mock Trial, the International Baccalaureate Program, and AFJROTC have played a major role in my professional development as I worked with others to reach a common goal.<br><br>

        Outside of my academic sphere, I have taken further steps to develop my professional experience through public service. I have served as a Council Member for the 4th District Riverside County Youth Advisory Council. In this position, I would convene with other council members from my district to discuss issues facing the youth in our community and create possible action plans to address those issues. I had the opportunity of working closely with the Board of Supervisors while I was a part of the Youth Advisory Council. I believe that professional experience can be found in a plethora of roles including hands-on community service. For three years, I had the pleasure of serving at Eisenhower Medical Center, a major hospital in the Coachella Valley. During my time at Eisenhower, I would learn the importance of active community involvement and, not only did I gain the chance to develop my professional experience, but also evolved my personal character.<br><br>

        While the time frame of my previous experiences was coming to an end, I started to search for new opportunities. I knew that while attending the University of California, Riverside I didn’t just want to be a student; I also wanted to be a leader. Fulfilling this goal, I am currently a Commissioner for the Riverside County Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Commission. The Commission works towards addressing the needs of juveniles in the justice and social welfare system across Riverside County. As a Commissioner, I have had the opportunity of interacting with various agencies including the California Superior Court, the District Attorney, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, the Riverside County Office of Education, and the Riverside County Public Defender. Additionally, the Commission works closely with various organizations that provide essential welfare services to the youth of the county.<br><br> 
        
        As a second-year public policy student at the University of California, Riverside I have learned that the space for professional development is limitless. Moved by my previous and current diverse professional experience, I always look forward to new opportunities that may be provided for my professional advancement and my commitment to public service.
